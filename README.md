# GAP Final Project 
A repo used to track the progress of a final project created in Graphics Application Class. 

**Project Description:**

The app I hope to create in the coming weeks will be a resource of animation references for both 2D and 3D animators. I hope to showcase some basic animation principles that the user can control using a GUI. 

*For example...*
  1. Allow the user to control the speed of the animation.
  2. Allow the user to control the camera angle, so they get a better view of the animation.
  3. Allow the user to start and stop the animation that they are viewing. 
  
  
## Animation Examples
Some of the basic animations I hope to cover (sorted from easiest to hardest) are..

  1. The bouncing ball (Easiest)
  2. The pendulum
  3. Wave cycles (Somewhat difficult) (Would require liquid physics)
  4. Walk cycles (Both 2-legged and 4-legged) (Most Difficult)
